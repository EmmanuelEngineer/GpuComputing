## GPU computing
### *Matrix transposition with sequential algorithms*

In this project is included:
- A pdf Report of the whole project with experiments made on my own hardware
- The main C file in which the algorithm is implemented
- A make file to compile the code
- A bash script called "makeandlaunch.sh" to automatize the test execution
- A JupiterNotebook to generate the graphs used in the report
- A requisite.txt file for using the Jupiter Notebook

The bash file is already configured to generate the needed folders for archiving the tests result. 
Before running the .sh file check the variables in the first few lines of code.
