### *Matrix transposition with sequential and parralel algorithms*

In this projects are included:
- Pdf Report of the whole project with experiments made on my own hardware
- The main C files in which the algorithm is implemented
- Make files to compile the code
- Bash scripts called "makeandlaunch.sh" to automatize the test execution
- JupiterNotebooks to generate the graphs used in the report
- requisite.txt files for using the Jupiter Notebook

The bash file are already configured to generate the needed folders for archiving the tests result. 
Before running the .sh file check the variables in the first few lines of code.
